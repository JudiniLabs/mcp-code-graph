## How this works

This MCP allows you to interact with the knowledge graphs available in your CodeGPT account.

Youâ€™ll be able to use these advanced graph-based queries across different MCP Hosts such as ChatGPT, Cursor, Windsurf, CodeGPT Extension, GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop, and others.

## Available Tools

`list_graphs`: Lists available repository graphs with basic information.

`get_code`: Retrieves the complete source code for a specific functionality from the graph.

`find_direct_connections`: Explores the direct relationships of a functionality within the code graph.

`nodes_semantic_search`: Semantically searches for code functionalities using natural language.

`docs_semantic_search`: Semantically searches repository documentation.

`get_usage_dependency_links`: Analyzes and lists functionalities affected by changes to a code entity.

## Prerequisites

Before using the CodeGPT MCP Server, ensure you have:

1. A CodeGPT account (sign up at [app.codegpt.co](https://app.codegpt.co))
2. Uploaded a repository to [Code Graph](https://help.codegpt.co/en/articles/9912447-code-graphs)
3. Get your API Key from [CodeGPT API Keys page](https://app.codegpt.co/user/api-keys) (required).
4. Get your Organization ID (optional) and Graph ID (optional).

# Installation

## Using npx
Add the following configuration to your MCP client (CodeGPT Extension, Cursor, Copilot, Claude Desktop, Windsurf, etc.):

```json
{
   "mcpServers": {
      "Deep Graph MCP": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y" , "mcp-code-graph@latest", 
         "CODEGPT_API_KEY", // Required
         "CODEGPT_ORG_ID", // Optional
         "CODEGPT_GRAPH_ID" // Optional
        ]
      }
   }
}
```

## Adding to Claude Code

Follow these steps to integrate Deep Graph MCP Server with Claude Code.

## Quick Setup

```bash
claude mcp add "Deep Graph MCP" npx -- -y mcp-code-graph@latest CODEGPT_API_KEY
```

**For team sharing**, add the `-s project` flag:

```bash
claude mcp add -s project "Deep Graph MCP" npx -- -y mcp-code-graph@latest CODEGPT_API_KEY
```

## Verification

```bash
# Verify installation
claude mcp list

# Get server details
claude mcp get "Deep Graph MCP"
```

## Advanced Workflows with Claude Code Custom Commands

Claude Code supports custom slash commands that combine multiple MCP Code Graph tools for comprehensive analysis workflows.

### Setup

**Copy the commands directory** from this repository to your project root:
```bash
cp -r .claude/ /path/to/your/project/
```

Commit to your project's git:
```bash
git add .claude/commands/
git commit -m "Add custom Claude Code commands for Deep Graph MCP"
```

## Available Commands
Repository-wide analysis commands (no parameters needed):

```bash
/project:analyze-architecture          # Complete architectural overview
